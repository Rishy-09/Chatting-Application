# 💬 Chatting Application

A simple chat application built in Java using Swing for the GUI and sockets for communication between a server and client. This project supports real-time text messaging with a clean and modern interface.

## 📖 Introduction

The Chatting Application enables text-based communication between a server and multiple clients. It features a sleek user interface and provides seamless message exchange. Built using Java, the application leverages Swing for the GUI and socket programming for networking.

- An IDE like [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) or [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/) (optional but recommended)

## 🗂 Project Structure

- **📁 chatting.application**: Contains the Java class files.
    - `Server.java`: Handles server-side operations, listening for incoming messages and displaying them.
    - `Client.java`: Manages client-side operations, enabling message sending and receiving.
